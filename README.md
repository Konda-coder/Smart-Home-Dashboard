- Entertainment systems

The dashboard simplifies complex home management tasks by offering features like:
- **Real-time device status monitoring**
- **Customizable automation**
- **Scene control**
- **Voice assistant integration** (e.g., Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri) for hands-free operation

### Key Features
1. **Device Categorization**: Control specific groups of appliances, such as lighting, HVAC, or multimedia setups.
2. **Security Monitoring**: Real-time alerts and live camera feeds for unusual activity.
3. **Energy Management**: Monitor appliance statuses and optimize energy efficiency.
4. **Advanced Automation**: Create preset scenes and trigger actions based on time, location, or device events.
5. **Customizable Interface**: Rearrange device tiles, create personalized layouts, and group devices by room.
6. **Notifications and Alerts**: Stay informed of security, appliance status, and energy usage.

### Benefits
- **Streamlined Tasks**: Simplifies the management of multiple devices.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Helps monitor and reduce energy consumption.
- **Improved Security**: Offers real-time updates and monitoring for peace of mind.
